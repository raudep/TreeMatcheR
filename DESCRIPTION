Description: Provides tools for the co-registration of single tree data in forest stands and forest plots, applicable to both static and dynamic data capture. The package implements a stem diameter weighted linking algorithm that improves linking accuracy when operating on diverse diameter stands with stem position errors. Additionally, it includes a co-registration quality metric threshold to discriminate between correct and incorrect stem map co-registrations with a high probability. This package implements the methodology described in Olofsson and Holmgren (2022) <doi:10.14214/sf.10712>, and was developed with the permission of the authors.
